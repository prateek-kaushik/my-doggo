# my-doggo
A simple app capable of searching through tons of dogs images.

This is a very basic app just to demonstrate the usage of few concepts like navigation using nav graph, LiveData and ViewModels, Pagination, Data source, ConstraintLayout, 
Search, Retorfit and Glide.
This can be helpful to a person who is new to these components and is looking for samples to understand the working knowledge of them.

This app uses Apis from thedogapi.com. So for this app to function fully, you need to visit this website, sign up and insert your api key in the class ApiClient.java.

The app is written in both Kotlin and Java.

It also includes few test cases written using Roboelectric that are again very basic in nature.
